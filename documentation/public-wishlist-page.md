# Public Wishlist Page

Accessible at `/l/{slug}` and shows the wishes that a user marked as public.

- Each wish uses **PublicWishCard**, displaying a 56px image or emoji avatar on the left with name and description to the right.
- A price appears under the description while an optional link icon overlays the avatar.
- Inline **RÃ©server** button lets visitors reserve a wish; states update to show who reserved it or allow cancellation.
 - Reserving a wish opens a bottom sheet requesting name and email with the confirm action in the header; cancelling a reservation uses a similar confirmation sheet.
